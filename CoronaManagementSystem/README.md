## System Features

- **Advanced Database:** Stores personal records of health fund members, including personal details and COVID-19 related data.
- **Member Management:** Ability to add, edit, and delete existing members of the health fund.
- **Vaccination Tracking:** Documentation and management of COVID-19 vaccination processes for each member.
- **Pandemic Data Management:** Recording and managing data on positive cases, recoveries, and relevant event dates.

## System Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture, with a client-side application interacting with server-side APIs, which in turn interacts with a database to store and retrieve information. Here's how the various components of the system interact:

### Client-Side Application:

- Developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the client-side application is responsible for presenting the user interface (UI) to the end-users.
- It communicates with the server-side APIs, to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and retrieve data via HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) over the network.

### Server-Side APIs:

- The server-side APIs, developed in .NET using Entity Framework, act as an intermediary between the client-side application and the SQL Server database.
- They handle incoming HTTP requests from the client-side application and execute corresponding logic.
- Server-side APIs interact with the SQL Server database to perform database operations such as inserting, querying, updating, and deleting data.

### Database:

- The database stores the application's data in a structured format.
- It consists of tables to organize data.
- Entity Framework is used for communication between the server-side APIs and the SQL Server database.

### Schematic View of Information in the Database:

-  User Table: Stores information about registered users and information related to their COVID-19 details.
- Vaccinations Table: Stores information about different types of vaccinations available.
- User Vaccinations Table: Represents the association between users and their vaccinations.

Access to vaccine list information (addition, deletion, etc.) is done through the Swagger user interface.
